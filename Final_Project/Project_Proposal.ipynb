    "### 1. Introduction:\n",
    "Air pollution stands out as a critical environmental threat to urban populations. While everyone is subject to exposure, there exists variation in pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability among different neighbourhoods. The repercussions of exposure to common air pollutants are extensive, encompassing links to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. New York City, being one of the world's most densely populated urban centers, grapples with persistent challenges regarding air quality, exerting a significant impact on the health and well-being of its residents. The presented indicators offer a temporal and geographical perspective to comprehensively characterize air quality and health trends in NYC. The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of air quality in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Objectives:\n",
    "The primary objectives of this project are multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach to understanding the dynamics of air quality in NYC. Employing a multifaceted approach that integrates data from various sources, I aim to explore the intricate interplay between traditional air quality indicators, forestry tree density, building density, industrial activities, and traffic density. I will mainly use the website NYC Open Data for receiving data. Also, NYC Department of Health provides data source of real-time air quality which is good for making hourly comparisons.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Not only the reasons also estimated health impacts of air pollution will be considered. It is an important environmental threat to the health of New York City residents. Exposures to two common air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), can worsen respiratory illness and heart conditions and contribute to premature deaths. Older adults, children and people with existing heart and lung disease are especially affected.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Fine particulate matter, also known as (PM2.5), are small airborne particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs. Major sources of PM2.5 include trucks, buses and cars, and the burning of fossil fuel to generate electric power and heat buildings. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to breathing problems, reduced lung function, heart disease and premature death. Ozone, also called smog, causes irritation and inflammation of the lungs and worsening of asthma. For that I plan to get hospitalization and death rates to calculate the health impact associated with the change in air quality in each neighbourhood. \n",
    "The ultimate goal is to provide nuanced insights that can inform decision-making processes and potentially guide policy interventions.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Industrial Analysis:** \n",
    "The amount of industrial area in a neighbourhood may affect its air quality in several ways. Manufacturing may emit pollutants, construction can kick up particulate matter, and increased truck traffic can lead to increased vehicular emissions. Obtaining detailed data on industrial activities in different NYC neighbourhoods, encompassing the types of industries, emission levels, and specific pollutants associated with each industrial sector.  \n",
    "**Traffic Density Exploration:** \n",
    "Traffic density affects a neighbourhood’s air quality in a few ways. Combustion engines emit \"tailpipe emissions\" such as PM2.5, NOx and carbon monoxide (CO), while dust from wear to tires and from braking contribute additional particulate matter to the air. Fetching data on traffic density, focusing on vehicular emissions and traffic-related pollutants. This will involve collaboration with city traffic management sources and other relevant databases.  \n",
    "**Forestry Tree Points:**\n",
    "The project includes the integration of forestry data, incorporating information on urban green spaces, tree cover, and forestry management practices. This expansion aims to explore the role of urban forestry in influencing air quality and public health. The project integrates forestry data to assess how urban trees and greenery contribute to mitigating pollution. This objective aligns with the broader goal of understanding the interconnectedness of urban ecosystems.  \n",
    "**Health Outcomes:**\n",
    "This objective involves fetching and integrating health-related data, including information on diseases such as asthma and other relevant health indicators. The goal is to correlate health data with environmental factors, providing insights into the broader health implications of the urban environment. This step aims to uncover correlations between air quality, industrial activities, traffic density, and prevalent health conditions, contributing to a holistic understanding of urban well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Methodology:\n",
    "The methodology for this project encompasses a series of meticulously planned steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results:  \n",
    "  \n",
